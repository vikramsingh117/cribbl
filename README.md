> **Note:**
> - The red warnings you might encounter during startup are related to Babel, which ensures compatibility with older browsers. These can be safely ignored.
> - The changes in the backend are minimal; they mostly consist of logs added during testing, and the only formatting adjustments made were converting single quotes (`'`) to double quotes (`"`), which is a result of automatic formatting.
> - No functional changes have been made to the code itself.
